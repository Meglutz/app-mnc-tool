# To Do List
Since the annoying ToDo commit messages really were a bad idea,
I've decided to compile a ToDo List here.

* [ ] Change DOMTable generation for InstructionOperations so that it can take more
      than two inputs (e.g. EXOR uses 2 read, 1 write input)
* [ ] Add InstructionOperation Info above the DOMTable
* [ ] Add header to insOp table
* [ ] Change CSS of insOp table to match reads / writes (probably needs id's to p elements of rows to identify which is which-> read / write)
