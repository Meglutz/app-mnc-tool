# To Do List
Since the annoying ToDo commit messages really were a bad idea,
I've decided to compile a ToDo List here.

* [X] Change DOMTable generation for InstructionOperations so that it can take more
      than two inputs (e.g. EXOR uses 2 read, 1 write input)
* [X] Add InstructionOperation Info above the DOMTable
* [X] Add header to insOp table
* [X] Change CSS of insOp table to match reads / writes (probably needs id's to p elements of rows to identify which is which-> read / write)
* [X] Center InstructionOperation table

* [ ] Make overlay scrollable
* [X] Add %@1 to % compiler (reader) switch to get the MNC Data more reliably
* [X] Fix compatility with decompiled MNC's **Attention: Check the README for instructions**

# Sanity check
* [ ] Check all regexes on single strings
* [ ] Remove `$` sings to enhance compatibility
* [ ] Add automated sanity checks (e.g. compare all RD, OR, ANDs to the amount of bitReadOps)
